nsfw,"##Not Safe For Work

^(For the porn lover in all of us.)

An all-encompassing pornography subreddit,  
from a lone nipple to the hardest of the hardcore.

&gt; NSFW is typically used to describe Internet content generally inappropriate for the typical workplace, i.e., would not be acceptable in the presence of your boss and colleagues (as opposed to SFW, Safe For Work). However, anything safe for the public will be considered SFW and will be removed.
